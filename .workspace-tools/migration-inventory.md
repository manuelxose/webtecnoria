Migration inventory - standalone migration

Components (examples / count):

- Many components under src/app/shared (preloader, arriba-flecha, testimonial, etc.)
- Core pages components under src/app/core/pages (home, kit-digital, servicios, blog, faq, contacto, about-us)
- Admin components under src/app/core/admin
- Auth components under src/app/auth

Services (found 10-20):

- src/app/services/auth.service.ts
- src/app/services/authguard.service.ts
- src/app/services/blog.service.ts
- src/app/services/firebase.service.ts
- src/app/services/image-resize.service.ts
- src/app/services/modal.service.ts
- src/app/services/notification.service.ts
- src/app/services/chat-bot.service.ts
- src/app/services/rastreo.service.ts
- src/app/services/window-object.service.ts

Directives / Pipes:

- ScrollspyDirective exists under src/app/shared/scrollspy.directive.ts

Notes / priorities:

- Start with leaf shared components: Preloader, ArribaFlecha, Testimonial, ClientsLogo, Services, SimplePricing, Member, Blog (shared), FormBottom.
- Then migrate core page leaf components (hero-section, service-card, pain-points, software-services, faq-section, contact-form, cta-final).
- Services should be provided via ApplicationConfig (provideHttpClient, provideAnimations) or providedIn:'root' if already.
- Routing migration will require creating src/app/app.routes.ts and updating imports across components.
